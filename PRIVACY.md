# Privacy Policy for No Alcohol

_Last updated: August 12, 2025_

Thank you for using the No Alcohol app (“the App”), developed as part of the noalcoholchallange repository. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and your choices regarding your information.

## Information Collection and Use

No Alcohol does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information, nor does it require you to provide any personal data.

The only piece of information the App asks for is the **last date when you consumed alcohol**. This date is stored **locally on your device** and is not shared with us, any third party, or transmitted over the Internet.

## Data Storage

- The last consumed alcohol date is stored only on your device.
- The App does **not** store any other information.
- This date is not accessible to anyone except you and is not transmitted or shared externally.

## Data Sharing

No Alcohol does **not** share, sell, or transfer any information to third parties. The App does not integrate with any external services or analytics providers.

## Children’s Privacy

No Alcohol does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 18. The App is safe for use by all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

As the App does not collect or process personal data, changes to this Privacy Policy will be minimal. However, if changes are made, we will update this document and notify users as appropriate.
